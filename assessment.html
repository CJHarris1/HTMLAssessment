  <p><strong>Super Bowl XLVII</strong> was an American football game between the American Football Conference (AFC) champion
    Baltimore Ravens and the National Football Conference (NFC) champion San Francisco 49ers to decide the National Football League (NFL) champion for the 2012 season.
    The Ravens defeated the 49ers by the score of 34–31, handing the 49ers their first Super Bowl loss in franchise history. The game was played on Sunday, February 3, 2013,
    at Mercedes-Benz Superdome in New Orleans, Louisiana. This was the tenth Super Bowl to be played in New Orleans, equaling Miami's record of ten in an individual city.
    This was the first Super Bowl to be held in New Orleans since Super Bowl XXXVI and it was the first to be played in that city since Hurricane Katrina on August 29, 2005.</p>

  <blockquote> <em><strong> For</strong> the first time in Super Bowl history, the game featured two brothers coaching against each other — Jim and John Harbaugh,
      head coaches of the San Francisco 49ers and Baltimore Ravens, respectively — earning it the nickname Har-bowl. Jim's son and John's nephew, Jay Harbaugh, was also on the
      Ravens' coaching staff. Super Bowl XLVII was the first to feature two teams that had undefeated records in previous Super Bowl games (Baltimore, 1–0; San Francisco, 5–0). The 49ers,
      who posted a regular-season record of 11–4–1, entered the game seeking their sixth Super Bowl win in team history (and first since Super Bowl XXIX at the end of the 1994 season),
      which would have tied the Pittsburgh Steelers for the most by a franchise. The Ravens, who posted a 10–6 regular-season record, made their second Super Bowl appearance in 12 years,
      having previously won Super Bowl XXXV. Ray Lewis, the Most Valuable Player (MVP) from that game, as well as the last remaining member of the inaugural Ravens roster from 1996, also played in this game,
      his last before his retirement from professional football.
    </em></blockquote>

  <p><strong>Baltimore</strong> dominated the first half of game, aided by quarterback Joe Flacco's 3 touchdown passes that gave the Ravens a 21–3 lead before their lead was cut to 21–6 just before halftime;
    the Ravens immediately picked back up their scoring after Jacoby Jones returned the second half kickoff a record 108 yards that would give them a 28–6 lead. However, a partial power outage in the Superdome
    following the return suspended play for 34 minutes (earning the game the added nickname of the Blackout Bowl). After play resumed, San Francisco began to rally, scoring 17 unanswered third-quarter points
    to cut the Ravens' lead to 28–23, and their lead continued to grow slimmer and slimmer in the fourth quarter. With the Ravens leading late in the game, 34–29, the 49ers drove down to the Baltimore 7-yard line just
    before the two-minute warning but turned the ball over on downs due to a controversial no-call on fourth down.
